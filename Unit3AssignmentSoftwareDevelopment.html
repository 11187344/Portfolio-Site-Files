  <div class="title-box"> In this unit, I learned about the entire software development process, starting from planning and designing software to writing, testing, and improving programs. We studied important programming concepts like variables, loops, conditional statements, and functions, which are the building blocks of coding. This helped me understand how programmers think logically to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, manageable steps. Learning these concepts gave me a strong foundation in programming principles.</div>

  <div class="intro-box">A big part of the unit involved hands-on practice with coding. I worked on writing simple programs using programming languages or software tools provided by the college. This practical work helped me apply what I’d learned in theory and gave me experience in real software development. I also learned how important it is to test programs carefully and debug any errors that come up. Debugging taught me patience and attention to detail, as finding mistakes in code can sometimes be tricky but is essential to making sure the program works properly.</div>

  <div class="title-box">By completing this unit, I’ve gained valuable skills in software development that go beyond just coding. I now have a better understanding of how software projects are planned and managed, and I feel more confident writing and testing programs. This experience has made me more interested in programming and exploring other areas of software design in the future. I know these skills will be useful if I decide to pursue a career in IT, software development, or any field that involves problem-solving and technology.</div>
